**PhD Candidate in Economics, IIM Indore**


**Hello! Welcome to my personal website.**

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. My research involves Economics of Education, Labour Economics, Gender Economics, and Development Economics. I am supervised by Dr. Ajay Sharma, Dr. Sutirtha Bandyopadhyay, and Dr. Shruti Tewari. 

My research focuses on the formation of human capital through the development of cognitive and noncognitive abilities, shaped by education, parental investment, and other influences. Skills and abilities hold both instrumental economic value and intrinsic worth, making their acquisition and impact on life outcomes a critical area of study. My dissertation, *Essays on Human Capital Formation*, examines these dynamics across three essays. The first explores how cognitive skills develop through interactions with noncognitive abilities. The second analyzes the effects of classroom peer gender composition on cognitive skill formation. The third investigates the relationship between cognitive and noncognitive abilities and skill-education mismatch in labor markets in developing countries.

My interest in abilities is driven by a broader concern about inequalities tied to ascribed identities. While skills reflect individual differences developed over time, gender and other ascribed identities impose systemic barriers that hinder equality, social mobility, and inclusive economic growth. As a result, my other projects focus on examining the impact of gender, caste, and similar identity-based penalties.
