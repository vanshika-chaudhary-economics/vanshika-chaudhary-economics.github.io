I am an Economics PhD candidate at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. My primary fields of interest are human capital formation, labour economics, gender economics, and development economics. My PhD Dissertation is titled "Essays on Human Capital Formation". The first essay deals with the causal complementarity of various noncognitive skills on different cognitive skills, which I investigate by specifying a stage-skill based function of technology of cognitive skill formation. The second essay deals with the impact of peer gender composition on the cognitive skills of children in a classroom at the primary school age of 8-9 years using rural-biased India sample. My third essay deals with skill-education/qualification mismatch in the labour markets across 12 low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), and this mismatch is correlated with cognitive and noncognitive skills of workers.
