I am an avid theatre enthusiast. In addition to being the Coordinator of my college's theatre and film-making club, "Adaa", during my Bachelor's, I have participated in local productions of two plays over the past two years. 
Most recently, in March 2025, I played the eponymous lead in George Bernard Shaw's "The Millionairess", or as she insists on letting everyone around her know over and over, over the course of a two and half hour long production "Epifania Ognisanti de Parerga" to a fairly positive audience reception. 

Prior to this, I played "Linda Thrombey" in "Knives Out: A Stage Adaptation" in February 2023. The play was covered by several local newspapers and also received raving audience reviews.
