excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate the effect of peer gender composition for students aged 9-10 years in India using data from Young Lives study, on different cognitive abilities of girls and boys. We exploit the de facto random assignment of students across classes, conditional on lagged ability and school fixed effects. We find that an increase in the proportion of female students in the classroom causes females’ math abilities to improve, while it causes boys’ English abilities to improve. When we exclude single-sex schools from the sample, we find that girls also experience a positive peer gender effect on English abilities. We find that our results are driven by public-school going students, who study in schools that do not offer instruction in English medium and schools that do not provide basic amenities like gender-segregated toilets for girls. Finally, we consider various channels through which peer gender effects cause improvement and heterogeneity in improvement in cognitive abilities, by gender.'
